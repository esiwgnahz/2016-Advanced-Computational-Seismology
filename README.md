## Scope
This course aims at discussing advanced computational methods in seismology, extending the basic methods encountered in the lecture on computational seismology in the summer term. In addition we learn (in more depth) some basic tools for code development (github, Jupyter notebooks). Some of the methods we will discuss are 1) advanced finite-difference concepts (optimal operators, summation by parts operators), 2) finite-volume methods, 3) discontinuous Galerkin methods, and others. 

## Format
Participating students will prepare basic theoretical concepts, simple python-based notebooks, and possibly report on some applications of methodologies in geosciences.

## Date and Location
Wednesdays 11:00-12:30, begin November 2, 2016
Room C111
